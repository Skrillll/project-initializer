# Setup Notes for Project Initializer

## Security Checks

1. Local Security Scans:
   - Run `make security-check` to perform local security scans.
   - This command is defined in the Makefile and uses the `scripts/security_check.py` script.

2. CI/CD Security Checks:
   - The CI/CD pipeline (defined in `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml`) automatically includes security checks for:
     - Every push
     - Every pull request
     - Weekly schedule (runs every Sunday)

## Important Reminders

1. Update SECURITY.md:
   - Replace `security@example.com` in the `SECURITY.md` file with an actual email address for security reports.

2. GitHub Secrets:
   - Set up the `SAFETY_API_KEY` secret in your GitHub repository settings if you're using the PyUp.io Safety Check action.
   - To do this:
     a. Go to your repository on GitHub
     b. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
     c. Click "New repository secret"
     d. Add the secret with the name `SAFETY_API_KEY` and the appropriate value

3. Other Secrets:
   - Remember to also set up `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD` secrets if you plan to use the PyPI deployment step in your CI/CD pipeline.

4. First Time Setup:
   - When pushing to GitHub for the first time, some CI/CD steps might fail due to missing secrets or incomplete setup. This is normal and can be addressed gradually as you set up each component of your project.

5. Gradual Implementation:
   - If you're new to CI/CD, consider starting with a simpler workflow (e.g., just running tests) and gradually add more steps as you become more comfortable with the process.

Remember to review and update these notes as your project evolves!
