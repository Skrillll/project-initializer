# Makefile Guide for Project Initializer

This document provides an overview of the Makefile used in the Project Initializer project.

## Features

The Makefile includes:

1. Variables for common commands and tools
2. OS detection for correct virtual environment activation
3. Targets for building, testing, cleaning, and deploying
4. Additional targets for environment setup, dependency installation, linting, and formatting
5. A help target for displaying available commands

## Available Commands

- `make install-dev`: Install development dependencies
- `make test`: Run tests
- `make lint`: Run linter
- `make format`: Format code with Black
- `make docs`: Build documentation
- `make build`: Build the package
- `make deploy`: Deploy the package (placeholder)
- `make clean`: Clean up build artifacts and cache files
- `make all`: Run all main tasks
- `make help`: Show available targets

## Usage

To use the Makefile:

1. Ensure the `Makefile` is in the root directory of your project
2. Make sure you have `make` installed on your system
3. Run `make help` to see all available commands

## Customization

The Makefile is designed to be flexible and reusable. You can easily modify or extend it as your project grows or your needs change.

Remember to update the `deploy` target with your actual deployment commands when you're ready to implement that functionality.

## Integration

To integrate this Makefile with your project:

1. Save the Makefile in the root directory of your project
2. Ensure all necessary tools (Python, pip, pytest, etc.) are installed
3. Run `make help` to verify the Makefile is working correctly

## Note

The Makefile uses conditional logic to work on both Unix-based systems and Windows. Ensure you're using an appropriate `make` tool for your operating system.
