   - [x] Implement log rotation.
   - [x] Add more contextual information to log messages.
   - [x] Create a centralized logging configuration file.
   - [x] Implement different log levels.
   - [x] Add detailed logging in FileManager and DirectoryManager classes.
   - [x] Log start and end of major operations.
   - [x] Add performance metrics logging.
   - [x] Implement debug-level logging.
   - [x] Add logging for skipped operations or unchanged files/directories.

2. **Add unit tests:**
   - [ ] Develop comprehensive unit tests for each component.
   - [ ] Add unit tests for error handling scenarios.
   - [ ] Increase test coverage.
   - [ ] Implement integration tests.
   - [ ] Add property-based testing for configuration parsing.

3. **Implement a validation step:**
   - [ ] Add a step to validate the configuration file before creating the project structure.
   - [ ] Ensure the configuration file has all required fields and correct formatting.
   - [ ] Implement schema validation for the YAML configuration files.

4. **Implement a dry-run option:**
   - [ ] Add a --dry-run flag to show potential changes without making actual modifications.

5. **Handle conflicts when files already exist:**
   - [ ] Implement a way to handle conflicts when files already exist in the output directory.

6. **User feedback and progress reporting:**
   - [ ] Implement a progress bar or spinner for long-running operations.
   - [ ] Provide more detailed success messages with summaries of created files/directories.

7. **Add support for templates:**
   - [ ] Create a system for managing and updating project templates.
   - [ ] Allow users to create and save custom templates.

8. **Create a configuration wizard:**
   - [ ] Implement an interactive CLI wizard to help users create their configuration files.

9. **Add a feature to update existing projects:**
   - [ ] Implement a command to update an existing project structure based on changes in the configuration file.

10. **Implement a feature to generate documentation:**
    - [ ] Automatically generate basic documentation for the created project structure.
    - [ ] Generate API documentation using tools like Sphinx.
    - [ ] Create user guides with examples for different project types.
    - [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex logic or design decisions.

11. **Add a summary at the end of the initialization process:**
    - [ ] Show the number of directories and files created.

12. **Performance optimization:**
    - [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks.
    - [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed configuration data.
    - [ ] Consider using asyncio for I/O-bound operations.

13. **Testing improvements:**
    - [ ] Increase test coverage, especially for error handling scenarios.
    - [ ] Implement integration tests for the entire project creation process.
    - [ ] Add property-based testing for configuration parsing.

14. **Add more customization options:**
    - [ ] Allow users to specify custom file templates.
    - [ ] Implement variable substitution in file contents.

15. **User feedback and progress reporting:**
    - [ ] Implement a progress bar or spinner for long-running operations.
    - [ ] Provide more detailed success messages with summaries of created files/directories.

These improvements will further enhance the robustness and user-friendliness of your Project Initializer tool. Let me know if you'd like to implement any of these suggestions or if you have any questions.
