# Setting Up a New Project

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new project using the Project Initializer.

1. Install the Project Initializer as described in the main README.md file.
2. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) that defines your project structure.
3. Run the initializer command:
   ```
   project-initializer init --config config.yaml --output .
   ```
4. Your project structure will be created based on the configuration file.

## Notes

- Your first workflow run might fail because of missing secrets or if you haven't set up PyPI deployment yet. That's okay for now.
- You can always update the workflow file to remove or modify steps that aren't relevant yet.
- The CI/CD pipeline set up is quite advanced for a beginner project. You might want to start with a simpler workflow that just runs tests, and gradually add more steps as you become more comfortable with the process.
